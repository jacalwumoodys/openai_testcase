mapping_desc="assistant: Based on your description, the 'Interest rate over split' seems to mean the interest rate applicable to a specific portion of the loan after it has been split into different parts. In the target schema, this might map to the field 'cpn (%)' which represents the current coupon, which is the interest rate on a bond. However, we have to be caution given that 'Interest rate over split' refers to a portion of a loan while 'cpn (%)' is on the whole bond. \
    If we could assume they work on the same principle, then it could be:\
Source Column: Interest rate over split\
Target Column: cpn (%)user: Interest rate over split:The \"Interest rate over split\" column for loans likely refers to the interest rate applicable to a portion of the loan amount after splitting the total loan into different parts, possibly under varying conditions or for different purposes. For instance, a loan may be split into two partsâ€”one part may have a fixed interest rate while the other has a variable rate.\
This column would specify the interest rate for the portion of the loan after such a split. Since there's no sample value, it's crucial to know the specific interest rate to fully understand the loan's cost structure for that part.loans:Interest rate over split: no sample value"
